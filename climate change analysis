Climate Change Analysis & Prediction Project

This project focuses on analyzing climate change data to understand long-term environmental trends and predict future climate conditions using data science and machine learning techniques.

The dataset includes historical climate indicators such as temperature, CO₂ levels, rainfall, and date-wise records. The goal is to clean and preprocess the data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualize important patterns, and build predictive models to identify climate trends over time.

# Technologies Used

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn
